Heuristics of UTXO deanonymization

Heuristic 4: “Wallets don’t spend unnecessary outputs”

Alice made a transaction with multiple inputs in order to pay her rent.

Alice’s UTXOs turned into inputs for rent tx

If there’s a unique output of the transaction with a value smaller than any of the inputs, then that’s the change.

Otherwise, the wallet would have spent an unneccessary UTXO.

Rent tx

Payment

Change

Outputs

From the eavesdropper point of view:

Inputs to rent tx

Rent tx

Outputs

Is this the only UTXO smaller than all inputs?

YES

It’s the change.

NO

It isn’t the change.

Now we know which address to keep following in order to learn more about Alice’s finances.
