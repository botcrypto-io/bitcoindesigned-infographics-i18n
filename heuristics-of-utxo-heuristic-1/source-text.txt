Heuristics of UTXO deanonymization

Heuristic 1: “All inputs of a transaction belong to the same wallet.”

Most of the times, joining multiple inputs is a way to make a payment that is larger than any of the inputs alone.

Amount to pay

UTXOs you’ll use

So you have a good chance to be right by saying that all those inputs used in the same transaction belonged to the same wallet (and probably the same person).

UTXOs in Bob’s wallet

Which implies that the transactions that previously generated those UTXOs were all made to pay the same person/wallet.

Tx to Bob

New UTXO

From the eavesdropper point of view:

Bob makes a 2.5 BTC payment.

Assuming the inputs used were from the same wallet

We can look at the txs that generated those UTXO

And conclude they were both payments to Bob.

So if one of the addresses that paid him is a known website for freelance programmers, we now know that Bob worked as a freelancer for them.
