Heuristics of UTXO deanonymization

Heuristic 2: “Changes are owned by addresses that were never seen in the blockchain.”

Imagine a transaction with 2 UTXOs created to different addresses.

Address A

Address B

Since modern wallets generate completely new addresses for the change, an eavesdropper can conclude:

If only one of them has never appeared in the blockchain, that’s probably the address generated for the change.

Change to Address B

From the eavesdropper point of view:

Bob’s Tx generates 2 UTXOs

Goes to Address A

Goes to Address B

Is on the blockchain

Isn’t on the blockchain

This is Bob’s change.

Now we know which address to keep following in order to learn more about Bob’s finances.
