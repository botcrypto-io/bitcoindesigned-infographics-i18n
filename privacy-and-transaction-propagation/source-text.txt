Privacy and Transaction Propagation

What is transaction propagation?

It’s about how your transaction propagates in the Bitcoin network after you send it to your peers.

Let’s visualize it by looking at the path your transaction is expected to take:

You send a transaction from your node.

Your node sends it to all of its peers.

The peers send it to all of their peers.

This is why it’s called a peer-to-peer network.

But note that it’s not a perfect path every time. Nodes can sometimes drop or not relay your transactions.

And so on. Eventually, a good part of the network knows about your transaction.

Your transaction now waits in the nodes’ mempools - a place for valid but unconfirmed transactions - until someone mines it.

Cool. Is there a problem with that?

This propagation happens a bit too transparently. So a very well connected node may be able to watch the propagation and infer information about the originating IP address of your transaction.

This revealing info can potentially give the eavesdropper access to:

Your real world identity

Citizen ID

Your physical location

Your Bitcoin balance

Because of IP related information and related metadata.

Because of blockchain transparency.

And, does the eavesdropper have to be a super fancy government agency that will probably not be looking for you?

NO.

Since it’s relatively cheap to set it up, it could be just anyone on the Internet.

Therefore, it increases the pool of people who might want to break your privacy this way to get your bitcoins.

Enter Dandelion

Dandelion is a proposed mechanism of a privacy-preserving transaction propagation.

The basic idea is to keep the transaction circulating in private for a while so, when it goes public, no one knows where it originally came from.

Private phase

Public phase

If we reorganize the propagation above, it’s visible that the path of the transaction reminds us of a dandelion flower and, therefore, the choice of name.

The private and public phases are referred to as “stem phase” and “fluff phase”, respectivelly.

Stem phase

Fluff phase

The concept was first developed by a group of mathematicians and now it’s being implemented as BIP 156.
