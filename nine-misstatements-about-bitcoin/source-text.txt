9 misstatements you’ll read about Bitcoin on the media

1  "Miners use computers capable of solving VERY COMPLEX computations!"

Mining hardware actually solves a very simple problem: guessing random numbers. Then they check them against a SHA2 function.

2   “Mining hardware VALIDATES transactions, ensuring they follow Bitcoin’s rules.”

Mining hardware doesn’t validate, it receives (hopefully validated) transactions from full nodes.

valid

Mining

3   "If somebody controls 51% of hashrate, he controls Bitcoin!"

Even if somebody controls 100% of hashrate he still cannot turn invalid transactions into valid (stealing, inflating, changing rules), he can just CENSOR transactions.

4   "Blockchains are more efficient, faster & cheaper than traditional, centralized tech. We can replace them to save costs & time!"

Blockchains are actually LESS efficient, SLOWER and more EXPENSIVE than centralized technologies.

Centralized

Blockchain

5   "Blockchains use encryption, so they are PRIVATE. We can use them to encrypt and protect sensitive data!"

Blockchain information is usually unencrypted and public to everyone in a pretty much irreversible way.

Blockchain transactions

6   “Bitcoin can be surpassed, blockchain tech is the real revolution. We should research blockchain without Bitcoin!"

Blockchains don’t really have much use other than being a building part of a decentralized asset (Bitcoin).

7   "Bitcoin is mostly used by violent people to commit crimes!"

Bitcoin will be mostly used by honest people protecting themselves against financial repression.

8   "Bitcoin's tech is trivial & nowadays obsolete, surpassed by other, most advanced ‘crypto’ projects!"

Bitcoin is the most advanced, up-to-date, bleeding-edge FOSS*/crypto project with one of the highest concentrations of brain-power.

*FOSS: Free Open Source Software

9   "Altcoins invented new stuff that Bitcoin devs couldn't imagine!"

MOST selling-points in altcoin marketing (tangles, ZKPs, etc.) have previously been evaluated & dismissed/deferred by Bitcoin pioneers.
