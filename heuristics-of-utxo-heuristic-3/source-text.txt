Heuristics of UTXO deanonymization

Heuristic 3: “Transactions from consumer’s wallets have two or fewer outputs.”

Bob sends a transaction to a service and there are two outputs, one is his change, the other is the payment to the service. But which one is which?

If we follow the next transactions of these 2 UTXOs, we might see that one of them will be in a transaction with various outputs. That’s probably the money that went to the service.

While the UTXO that went into a transaction with two or fewer outputs is identifiable as the change.

From the eavesdropper point of view:

Bob’s tx

Is the UTXO change or payment?

Next tx

Next tx

2 UTXOs

Multiple UTXOs

It was the change

It was the payment

Again, now we know which address is in Bob’s control, so we can follow it to learn more about Bob’s finances.
